Building a Modern, Responsive Calculator with Tailwind CSS &amp; JavaScript 🚀  Building a Modern, Responsive Calculator with Tailwind CSS & JavaScript 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest mini-project: a fully functional Web Calculator built with a focus on modern UI/UX design.

💡 Key Features:

Glassmorphism UI: Implemented using Tailwind CSS backdrop-blur and transparency utilities for a sleek, modern look.

Responsive Design: Fully fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

JavaScript Logic: Handles arithmetic operations, keyboard events, and error handling (like division by zero) without relying on external libraries.

User Experience: Includes button press animations and a calculation history view.

This project was a great way to refine my DOM manipulation skills and explore complex styling with Tailwind.
